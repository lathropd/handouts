# Online research

Online research is about adopting an investigative, "documents, data and web" mindset. 
You must believe that every question you seek to answer can be answered
with data, a document or on a website. 

In other words, you must believe that everyone and everything leaves a trail you can find ...
although the information won't always be on the web, your default assumption should be that 
you can get the smell of the information there. (Although nothing substitutes for pulling 
paper at the courthouse.)
